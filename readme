I personally optimized Kmeans.cpp in sequential mode. The new file named Kmeans_seq.cpp. To run this c++ file, please run command line:

./kmeans2

The kmeans_mpi.cpp used for speedup kmeans clustering in parallel mode by MPI. Running 

mpirun -n <number of processor> ./kmeans_mpi 

to check my results.

File kmeans.cpp is the original file which implement kmeans algorithm. But there are lots of unneseccery For loop in the line. You can compare

its result to the optimized one in results folder.
